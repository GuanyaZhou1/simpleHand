**A Simple Baseline for Efficient Hand Mesh Reconstruction (simpleHand)** has been accepted by CVPR2024.  This paper ropose a simple yet effective baseline that not only surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods but also demonstrates computational efficiency. SimpleHand can be easily transplant to mainstream backbones and datasets.
